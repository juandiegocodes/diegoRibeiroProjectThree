WORD STORM

Built using jQuery and Javascript in the third week of bootcamp, this might be my favorite project so far.
A typing game where the user has to enter the word before it reaches the bottom of the screen. 
Remember to look at the clock and match as many words as possible in two minutes.

These were the tools used for thi project:
    jQuery
    HTML
    CSS3
    JavaScript
    Responsive Design
